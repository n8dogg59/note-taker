## Features
* Created server.js that connects the front-end and the back-end.
* The app uses get routes to get the information from the server and send to the user/front-end and post routes to get the information from the user/front-end and add to the server.
* The app also allows the user to delete notes through a delete() method that deletes the note off the servers json file and also deletes it off the users front-end screen.
* Used Heroku to make the application production ready.
